<h1 style="color:#000080;font-size:3vw">Introduction To All Languages</h1>
<h2><a href="c_overview.html">1.C:</a></h2>
<ul><li>C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications.</li><br>
<li>Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System in the early 1970s.</li></ul>

<h2><a href="cpp_overview.html">2.C++ Programming Language :</a></h2>
<ul><li>C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language.</li><br>
<li>It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style."</li><br>
<li>In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.</li><br>
<li>C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features.</br> Initially, the language was called "C with classes" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of "classes." </li></br>
<li>However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.It is pronounced "see-plus-plus."</li></ul><br>

<h2><a href="java_overview.html">3.java:</a></h2>
<ul><li>Java is a programming language that produces software for multiple platforms.</li><br>
<li> When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS.</li><br>
<li> Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages.</li><br>
<li>Java was developed in the mid-1990s by James A. Gosling, a former computer scientist with Sun Microsystems.</li></ul><br>

<h2><a href="html_overview.html">4.Html:</a></h2>
<ul><li>Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. HTML elements are represented by tags.</li><br>
<li>HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on.
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.</li></ul><br>

<h2><a href="css_overview.html">5.Css:</a></h2>
<b>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</b>
<ul><li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
<li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
<li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li></ul><br>
<h2><a href="javascript_overview.html">6.Javascript:</a></h2>
<ul><li>JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.</li><br>
<li>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.</li><br>
<li>JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:</li><br>
<ol><li> HTML to define the content of web pages.</li><br>
<li> CSS to specify the layout of web pages.</li><br>
<li>JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages.</li></ol><br>
<li>Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript.Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.</li><br>
<li>HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</li></ul> <br>
<h2><a href="python_overview.html">7.Python:</a></h2> 
<ul><li>Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. In July 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the language community after 30 years.</li><br>

<li>Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.</li></ul><br>
